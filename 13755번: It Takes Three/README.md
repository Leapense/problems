<p>Given three rectangles, determine if they can be glued together to form a square. The rectangles can be rotated, but they cannot overlap.</p>

<p>Here’s an example of how three rectangles, 8x2, 1x6 and 7x6, can be put together to form a square 8x8:</p>

## 입력


<p>Each input will consist of a single test case. Note that your program may be run multiple times on different inputs. There will be exactly three lines of input.</p>

<p>The first line of input contains two integers w1 and h1 (1 ≤ w1,h1 ≤ 100), which are the width and height of the first rectangle.</p>

<p>The second line of input contains two integers w2 and h2 (1 ≤ w2,h2 ≤ 100), which are the width and height of the second rectangle.</p>

<p>The third line of input contains two integers w3 and h3 (1 ≤ w3,h3 ≤&nbsp;100), which are the width and height of the third rectangle.</p>



## 출력


<p>Output 1 if the two rectangles can be put together to form a square, and 0 of they cannot.</p>
