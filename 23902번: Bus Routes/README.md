# 23902번: Bus Routes

## 문제 설명


<p>Bucket is planning to make a very long journey across the countryside by bus. Her journey consists of&nbsp;<b>N</b>&nbsp;bus routes, numbered from 1 to&nbsp;<b>N</b>&nbsp;in the order she must take them. The buses themselves are very fast, but do not run often. The i-th bus route only runs every&nbsp;<b>X<sub>i</sub></b>&nbsp;days.</p>

<p>More specifically, she can only take the i-th bus on day&nbsp;<b>X<sub>i</sub></b>, 2<b>X<sub>i</sub></b>, 3<b>X<sub>i</sub></b>&nbsp;and so on. Since the buses are very fast, she can take multiple buses on the same day.</p>

<p>Bucket must finish her journey by day&nbsp;<b>D</b>, but she would like to start the journey as late as possible. What is the latest day she could take the first bus, and still finish her journey by day&nbsp;<b>D</b>?</p>

<p>It is guaranteed that it is possible for Bucket to finish her journey by day&nbsp;<b>D</b>.</p>
