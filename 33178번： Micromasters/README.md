<p>The Department of Computer Engineering at Sharif University of Technology has recently initiated a professional education program known as Micromasters. This program offers a set of courses designed to empower students with specialized knowledge and skills in various domains of computer science and engineering. As an incentive to promote the program, the department has introduced a referral system wherein individuals who refer other students to the Micromasters program receive a $10\%$ discount for each referred student on their own course registrations.</p>

<p>Mina is a talented student who is passionate about spreading the benefits of the Micromasters program. With each referral, Mina’s list of discounts grows, and now the following question arises: given the number of students who are referred by Mina, how many courses can she enroll in for free?</p>
