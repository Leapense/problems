<p>You have a diet plan for the next $N$ days (numbered from $1$ to $N$). During day $i$, you need to drink exactly $P_i$ mL of milk. Alternatively, you can consume a biscuit instead, as a replacement for milk on that day.</p>

<p>Currently, you only have $M$ mL of milk and $K$ biscuits. If there is not enough milk to drink on a day and you run out of biscuits, then your diet plan stops.</p>

<p>Determine the maximum number of days you can maintain your diet plan.</p>



## 입력


<p>The first line consists of three integers $N$ $M$ $K$ ($1 ≤ N ≤ 100$; $0 ≤ M, K ≤ 100$).</p>

<p>The next line consists of $N$ integers $P_i$ ($1 ≤ P_i ≤ 100$).</p>



## 출력


<p>Output a single integer representing the maximum number of days you can maintain your diet plan.</p>
