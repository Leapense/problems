## 문제

[문제 링크](https://boj.kr/11322)


<p>Given an integer N, what is the smallest positive integer X, whose representation in base 10 consists only of digits ’0’ and ’1’, such that X is divisible by N?</p>



## 입력


<p>The first line of the input file starts with the integer T, the number of test cases (1 ≤ T ≤ 100). Each test case consists of a number N(1 ≤ N ≤ 300) on a line.</p>



## 출력


<p>For each test case, output the smallest positive number X such that X is divisible by N and it contains only digits ’0’ and ’1’. Given the constraints, it is guaranteed that there always is a solution (for any positive N) and, in this problem, it will always fit into a 64-bit signed integer.</p>
