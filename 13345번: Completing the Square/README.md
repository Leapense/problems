<p>In the heart of your home city, there is an old square, close to the train station, appropriately<br>
called Station Square. It used to look like a perfect square: four sides of equal length joined&nbsp;by right angles. However, it hasn’t looked like this for decades, as one of the four corners was&nbsp;destroyed by bombings in the Second World War. After the war, the square was rebuilt as a&nbsp;quarter circle, and it has looked like that ever since. (In other words, it looks like an isosceles&nbsp;right triangle, except that the hypothenuse is not a straight line but a circular arc.) This is&nbsp;illustrated in the figure below, which corresponds with Sample Input 1.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">(a) The old square, in the&nbsp;shape of an actual square. /&nbsp;(b) The current square, looking&nbsp;more like a quarter circle.</p>

<p>Recently, the city counsil voted to completely remodel the train station and its surroundings,&nbsp;which includes restoring Station Square to its original state. Therefore they need to determine&nbsp;the exact location of the fourth corner. This task is too complicated for ordinary aldermen,&nbsp;so the city decided to hire a top scientist. That would be you! Please help the city complete&nbsp;the square, and you will be greatly rewarded!</p>



## 입력


<p>There are three lines of input. Each line contains two integers denoting the x and y coordinates&nbsp;of one of the corners of the current square (−10<sup>4</sup> ≤ x, y ≤ 10<sup>4</sup>).</p>



## 출력


<p>Output one line with two space-separated integers denoting the x and y coordinates of the&nbsp;long-lost fourth corner.</p>
