[문제 링크](https://boj.kr/11470)


<p>Eva is a third-grade elementary school student. She has just learned how to perform addition and subtraction of arbitrary-precision integers. Her homework is to evaluate some expressions. It is boring, so she decided to add a little trick to the homework. Eva wants to add some plus and minus signs to the expression to make its value as large as possible.</p>



## 입력


<p>The single line of the input file contains the original arithmetic expression. It contains only digits, plus (‘+’) and minus (‘-’) signs.</p>

<p>The original expression is correct, that is:</p>

<ul>
<li>numbers have no leading zeroes;</li>
<li>there are no two consecutive signs;</li>
<li>the last character of the expression is a digit.</li>
</ul>

<p>The length of the original expression does not exceed 1000 characters.</p>



## 출력


<p>Output a single line — the original expression with some plus and minus signs added. Output expression must satisfy the same correctness constraints as the original one. Its value must be as large as possible.</p>
