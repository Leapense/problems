[문제 링크](https://boj.kr/20240)


<p>Iris likes to draw different shapes on a grid paper. Her favorite shape is a square. She has recently tried to draw a square with area $s$, but since she uses a grid paper, she wants all the vertices of the square to have integer coordinates.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://upload.acmicpc.net/4e9811eb-7599-4e72-bc3e-5ae61f3afaec/-/preview/" style="width: 393px; height: 384px;"></p>

<p>Can you help her find such a square?</p>



## 입력


<p>The input contains a single integer $s$ ($1\le s\le 1000$).</p>



## 출력


<p>If it is possible to construct the required square, output four pairs of integers: the coordinates of the vertices of the square, in any order. All coordinates should be in the range from $-10^9$ to $10^9$. If there are multiple answers, output any of them.</p>

<p>If it is impossible to construct the required square, print "<code>Impossible</code>".</p>
