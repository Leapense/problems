[문제 링크](https://boj.kr/26570)

<p>A semiperfect number is a number that all or some of the divisors (not including itself) of the number can be added together to get the original number. For instance, the number 12 has the following applicable divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6. The divisors 6, 4, and 2 can be added together to get 12, therefore 12 is a semiperfect number. Given a number, determine whether or not it is semiperfect.</p>

## 입력

## 출력

<p>If m is semiperfect print “Semiperfect”, otherwise, print “NOT Semiperfect”.</p>
