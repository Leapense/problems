## 문제

[문제 링크](https://boj.kr/6076)


<p>Farmer John suffered a terrible loss when giant Australian cockroaches ate the entirety of his hay inventory, leaving him with nothing to feed the cows. He hitched up his wagon with capacity C (1 &lt;= C &lt;= 50,000) cubic units and sauntered over to Farmer Don's to get some hay before the cows miss a meal.</p>

<p>Farmer Don had a wide variety of H (1 &lt;= H &lt;= 5,000) hay bales for sale, each with its own volume (1 &lt;= V_i &lt;= C). Bales of hay, you know, are somewhat flexible and can be jammed into the oddest of spaces in a wagon.</p>

<p>FJ carefully evaluates the volumes so that he can figure out the largest amount of hay he can purchase for his cows.</p>

<p>Given the volume constraint and a list of bales to buy, what is the greatest volume of hay FJ can purchase? &nbsp;He can't purchase partial bales, of course. Each input line (after the first) lists a single bale FJ can buy.</p>
