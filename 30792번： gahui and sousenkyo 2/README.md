<p>Gahui is watching the annual character election. After the election, <strong>The top 16 characters</strong> receive enormous benefits for one year. For that reason, fans vote passionately to get their favorite characters into the top 16. Remarkably, at least one Cinderella appears in every election, achieving an outstanding outcome.</p>

<p>Of course, the ranking is high if <strong>the number of votes is high</strong>. Gahui <strong>supports only one character</strong>. Find the ranking of the character she supports.</p>



## 입력


<p>The first line gives $n$, the number of characters participating in the election.</p>

<p>The second line gives the number of votes for the character Gahui supports.</p>

<p>In the third line, $n-1$ integers are given, separated by spaces. These integers represent the number of votes for characters that Gahui does not support.</p>



## 출력


<p>Print the ranking of the character Gahui supports. </p>
