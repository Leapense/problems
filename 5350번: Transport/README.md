[문제 링크](https://boj.kr/5350)


<p>You have a transport plane that has to deliver items to a remote location. You would like to load all the items on the plane, but you can not exceed the plane’s weight capacity, W. Given n items of known weights w<sub>1</sub>, w<sub>2</sub>, …, w<sub>n</sub> and values v<sub>1</sub>, v<sub>2</sub>, …, v<sub>n</sub> find the most valuable subset of the items that fit into the plane without exceeding the capacity, W.</p>



## 입력


<p>The first line of input will be a positive integer indicating the number of problem sets. Each problem set will start with a line that has two positive integers, n and W, where n is the number of items and W is the capacity of the plane. The next n lines will have two integers, w and v, where w is the weight and v is the value of the item. All weights and values will be positive integers, and the number of items in any problem set will be no more than 20.</p>



## 출력


<p>For each problem set print, on a separate line, the total value of the most valuable subset that the plane can transport without exceeding its capacity W.</p>
