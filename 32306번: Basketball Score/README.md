<p>Given how many shots of each type two teams made, determine the winner.</p>



## 입력


<p>The first input line contains three integers (each between 0 and 99 inclusive), indicating how many shots of each type Team1 made. The first integer indicates 1-pointer shots, the second integer indicates 2-pointer shots, and the third integer indicates 3-pointer shots.</p>

<p>The second input line provides the shots made by Team2, following the same format as the first input line.</p>



## 출력


<p>Print 1, 2 or 0 (zero), indicating which team won or if the game was a tie. The team with higher score (total points) wins. If both teams have the same total points, then the game is a tie.</p>
