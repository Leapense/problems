## 문제

[문제 링크](https://boj.kr/12555)


<p>I want to make an online poker website. A very important component of such a system is the random number generator. It needs to be fast and random enough. Here is a compromise I came up with. I need a way to generate random numbers of length at most&nbsp;<strong>D</strong>. My plan is to select a prime number&nbsp;<strong>P</strong>&nbsp;≤ 10<sup><strong>D</strong></sup>. I am also going to pick non-negative integers&nbsp;<strong>A</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>B</strong>. Finally, I'm going to pick an integer seed&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>&nbsp;between 0 and&nbsp;<strong>P</strong>-1, inclusive.</p>

<p>To output my sequence of pseudo-random numbers, I'm going to first output&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>&nbsp;and then compute the new value of&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>&nbsp;like this:<br>
<code><strong>S</strong>&nbsp;:= (<strong>A</strong>*<strong>S</strong>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<strong>B</strong>) mod&nbsp;<strong>P</strong>.</code></p>

<p>Then I will output the new value of&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>&nbsp;as the next number in the sequence and update&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>again by using the same formula. I can repeat this as many times as I want.</p>

<p>Do you think that this is a good random number generator? Can you write a program that takes&nbsp;<strong>K</strong>&nbsp;consecutive elements of a sequence that was generated by my random number generator, and prints the next element of the sequence?</p>



## 입력


<p>The first line of the input gives the number of test cases,&nbsp;<strong>T</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>T</strong>&nbsp;test cases follow. Each one starts with a line containing&nbsp;<strong>D</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>K</strong>. The next line contains&nbsp;<strong>K</strong>&nbsp;consecutive elements generated by a random number generator of the kind described above.</p>

<h3>Limits</h3>

<ul>
<li>1 ≤&nbsp;<strong>T</strong>&nbsp;≤ 100.</li>
<li>1 ≤&nbsp;<strong>K</strong>&nbsp;≤ 10.</li>
<li>The&nbsp;<strong>K</strong>&nbsp;integers will be consecutive elements of a sequence generated by a random number generator of the type described above.</li>
<li>1 ≤&nbsp;<strong>D</strong>&nbsp;≤ 4.</li>
</ul>



## 출력


<p>For each test case, output one line containing "Case #x: y", where x is the case number (starting from 1) and y is either the next number in the sequence, or the string "I don't know." if the answer is ambiguous.</p>
