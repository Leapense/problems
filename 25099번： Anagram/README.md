<p>Two words are anagrams if the letters of the first word can be reordered to obtain the second one. An instance of anagrams is the pair “listen” and “silent”.</p>

<p>You are given a list of words, each word consisting of lowercase letters. Your goal is to filter this list by dropping any word whose anagram has already appeared earlier on the list.</p>



## 입력


<p>The first line contains $n$, the length of the list. This is followed by $n$ lines, each containing one word.</p>



## 출력


<p>Print out the list of words without anagrams, one word per line. The words should appear in the same order as given in the input.</p>
