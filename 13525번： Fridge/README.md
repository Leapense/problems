[문제 링크](https://boj.kr/13525)


<p>The technology behind the fridge has changed little over the years. Even so, many of the original&nbsp;owners of the Fred W. Wolf domestic refrigerator of 1913 would be amazed by the size and&nbsp;features of the modern appliances. However, since the 1960s one thing has been common for all&nbsp;fridge owners around the world: fridge magnets.</p>

<p>An effective, albeit lazy, way to keep a small child entertained is to supply them with a set of&nbsp;magnetic numbers and a large magnetic surface, such as said fridge, to provide the playing field&nbsp;upon which to apply these digits.</p>

<p>Far from a time-wasting exercise, this provides valuable training in the mathematical field of&nbsp;counting: moving the digits around to form “1”, “2”, and so on up to such heights as “10”, “11”,&nbsp;“12”, and even beyond.</p>

<p>The possibilities are endless! ...Or at least, they would be, if the supply of digits was not limited.&nbsp;Given the full list of what numbers we are in possession of, what is the smallest positive number&nbsp;that cannot be made using each of digits at most once?</p>



## 입력


<ul>
<li>One string of at most 1000 digits, containing the available digits in no particular order.</li>
</ul>



## 출력


<ul>
<li>One line containing one positive integer: the smallest natural number that it is not possible to assemble from the supplied digits.</li>
</ul>
