<p>Your older brother is an amateur mathematician with lots of experience. However, his memory&nbsp;is very bad. He recently got interested in linear algebra over finite fields, but he does not&nbsp;remember exactly which finite fields exist. For you, this is an easy question: a finite field of&nbsp;order q exists if and only if q is a prime power, that is, q = p<sup>k</sup> holds for some prime number&nbsp;p and some integer k ≥ 1. Furthermore, in that case the field is unique (up to isomorphism).</p>

<p>The conversation with your brother went something like this:</p>

## 입력


<p>The input consists of one integer q, satisfying 1 ≤ q ≤ 10<sup>9</sup>.</p>



## 출력


<p>Output “yes” if there exists a finite field of order q. Otherwise, output “no”.</p>
